# 🔌 Virtual Circuit Board Simulator

**A Python-based virtual circuit prototyping tool for simulating and visualizing basic electronic components and circuit behavior – without any physical hardware.**

---

## 🖥️ Overview

This project aims to democratize electronics learning and prototyping by offering a fully **software-only** circuit board simulation experience. Designed using Python and GUI libraries, it allows you to interact with electronic components like resistors, capacitors, batteries, and LEDs on a virtual board in real time.

Whether you're an engineering student, an educator, or a hobbyist, this tool helps you:
- Visualize how circuits behave.
- Experiment without risking components.
- Learn electronics even without a physical lab.
